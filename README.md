# test-repo-01
A Test repository (temporary)

This repository is used to test the robaone/initialize-action as described in https://robaone.atlassian.net/browse/PD-12.

This repository will be setup like a mono repo with individual projects in folders.  The workflow will call the action in order to create a matrix object to be used to run actions against individual projects that are affected by a change.
